# Parasite_Detection

Malaria is a lethal disease caused by a parasite
known as Plasmodium. The current common technique of med-
ical diagnosis for the disease includes manually identifying and
counting the parasitized cells by performing light microscopy of
thick and thin stained blood smears. Since this procedure is car-
ried out manually, there is always a scope of misdiagnosis either
due to poor familiarity with the procedure by a diagnostician
or problems in accessing and acquiring the proper equipments
required for diagnosis. In this project, we explore different
techniques for the automation and unsupervised detection of
malarial parasites.
